# What the Project is about?
    This is a simple responsive Drawing website on canvas built using HTML, CSS,JavaScript. The website allows you to draw any picture or designe using mouse and touch screen. I added color pallet and line width to change the color and the width of your line as desired. besides doodling, I have added some geometric shape buttons such as ( rectangle,circle,triangle,straight line) to help you with your plans. All the shapes reacts with the color pallet and line width to have varios options. Moreover, I added a few more buttons such as ( clear canvas,undo,redo,eraser) to help you fix any mistake during your drawing. As soon as you finished your project you can save it automaticly on your device as a picture. Another feature I added was uplouding a picture to edit it if required.

## Design
    ![](image/canvas%20desplay.png)
    This is  a picture of the website showing the full canvas with the tools bar. The tool bar was positioned in the center bottom of the page as belived would more comfortable or user to be in that posotion.
    I used picturse instead of texts to discribe each buttns function. The icons (Trash, undo,redo, eraser, pencil, save) were used from w3school and set the colors acording my prefrance as showen in the screenshot https://www.w3schools.com/icons/ . However, I found it mor e appropreat to use css for icons(square,cercle,triangle) and I used How to -CSS shape https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_shapes.asp as shown in the link.



## Where it works

    The website was tested on (Chrome,Safari,Microsoft Edge ) and works perfectly on tablet and mobile phone devices and it is responsive. However, it is recomended to be used on big screen due to the nature of the website that needs space on the screen to do your drawing on it.
